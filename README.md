# Animal-Image-Classifier-Cat-Dog-Fox-Prediction-with-TensorFlow
This project implements a deep learning-based animal image classifier capable of predicting whether an input image contains a cat, dog, or fox. The system uses a TensorFlow/Keras model trained on image datasets and provides a clean prediction pipeline that works with any test folder of images.
